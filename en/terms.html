    <h1>SingKANA Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") set forth the conditions for using SingKANA (the "Service"). Please read the Terms carefully before using the Service.</p>

    <h2>Article 1 (Scope)</h2>
    <p>1. These Terms apply to all relationships related to the use of the Service.</p>
    <p>2. Users of the Service ("Users") are deemed to have agreed to these Terms at the time they use the Service.</p>
    <p>3. The Terms may be changed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The updated Terms take effect when posted on the Service.</p>

    <h2>Article 2 (Overview of the Service)</h2>
    <p>1. The Service provides a tool that displays pronunciation guidance in Japanese kana based on text entered by Users (e.g., English lyrics).</p>
    <p>2. The Service offers a free plan ("Free") and a paid plan ("Pro").</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Free plan: Basic conversion features are available at no charge.</li>
      <li>Pro plan: Advanced features such as more precise conversion, comparison view, and a singability score are available (JPY 980/month).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Basic conversion in the Service is performed on the User's device (in the browser). However, when using the Pro plan feature "AI Pronunciation Correction", the lyrics/text are sent through our servers to OpenAI's API (GPT) for pronunciation correction. The sent text is not stored on our servers after processing (except for cache). For OpenAI's handling of data, please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy.</p>
    <p>4. When generating a PDF practice sheet (one-shot purchase), the lyrics/text are also sent to the server for PDF generation processing.</p>

    <h2>Article 3 (Registration and Accounts)</h2>
    <p>1. No membership registration is required to use the Service. However, payment information registration is required to use the Pro plan.</p>
    <p>2. Users may register their email address using the waitlist feature provided on the Service. By registering, Users may receive priority notifications and benefits for the Pro plan.</p>
    <p>3. Users represent and warrant that the registered email address is accurate and up to date.</p>

    <h2>Article 4 (Fees and Payments)</h2>
    <p>1. The Pro plan fee is JPY 980 per month (tax included) or JPY 9,600 per year (tax included).</p>
    <p>2. Payments are processed via Stripe's payment services. Please refer to Stripe's terms and privacy policy for details.</p>
    <p>3. Fees are charged automatically on initial registration and on each monthly or annual renewal date (auto-renewal).</p>
    <p>4. Users may cancel the Pro plan at any time through the billing management page on the Service. After cancellation, the Pro plan remains available until the end of the current billing period, after which the User is automatically moved to the Free plan.</p>
    <p>5. Users can continue to use Pro features for any period that has already been paid for.</p>
    <p>6. Due to the nature of digital services, refunds are generally not available. If an issue attributable to us (e.g., double-charging) is confirmed, we will handle it on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <h2>Article 5 (Copyright and Related Rights)</h2>
    <p>1. Lyrics of commercial songs are copyrighted by lyricists, music publishers, and other rights holders. The Service has no intention of infringing such rights.</p>
    <p>2. The Service provides a function to convert lyrics/text to kana on the User's device; the operator's server does not retain the lyrics themselves.</p>
    <p>3. Users shall not perform the following acts with respect to the results produced by the Service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publishing the full lyrics, or a near-complete portion, on the internet in a way that makes the lyrics identifiable</li>
      <li>Commercial use (paid distribution, embedding into products for sale, etc.) without permission from the rights holder</li>
      <li>Any other use that violates rules/guidelines set by the rights holders of each song</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. If a User causes a dispute with a third party in connection with the use of the Service, the User shall resolve the dispute at their own responsibility and expense, and the operator shall bear no responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Article 6 (Prohibited Conduct)</h2>
    <p>Users must not engage in the following acts when using the Service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acts that violate laws or public order and morals</li>
      <li>Acts that infringe copyrights, trademarks, or other rights of third parties</li>
      <li>Acts that interfere with the operation of the Service or impose excessive load on servers/networks</li>
      <li>Unauthorized access, misuse, reverse engineering, etc.</li>
      <li>Use of automation tools or scripts to bypass rate limits</li>
      <li>Any other acts deemed inappropriate by the operator</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 7 (Disclaimers)</h2>
    <p>1. The Service is provided "as is". The operator does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for singing of conversion results.</p>
    <p>2. The operator shall not be liable for any damages incurred by Users as a result of using the Service.</p>
    <p>3. The operator shall not be liable for damages caused by changes, interruptions, suspension, or termination of the Service.</p>
    <p>4. The operator shall not be liable for damages caused by malfunctions or downtime of the payment service (Stripe).</p>

    <h2>Article 8 (Changes to the Service)</h2>
    <p>The operator may change, add, suspend, or terminate the Service without prior notice to Users. However, for changes to the Pro plan price or important feature changes, the operator will notify Users whenever reasonably possible.</p>

    <h2>Article 9 (Changes to the Terms)</h2>
    <p>The operator may change these Terms without prior notice to Users when deemed necessary. The updated Terms take effect when posted on the Service.</p>

    <h2>Article 10 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction)</h2>
    <p>1. These Terms are governed by the laws of Japan.</p>
    <p>2. In the event of disputes related to the Service, the Japanese court having jurisdiction over the operator's location shall have exclusive agreed jurisdiction.</p>
