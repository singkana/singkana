# SCA: Cursor Rules for SingKANA

## Security & Safety
- Never read or output secrets (.env, secrets.env)
- Propose changes as diffs; do not overwrite files blindly
- Do not change routes or env handling without explaining impact
- Keep BASE_DIR path-safe (Path(__file__).resolve().parent)
- Respect .sca/* as canonical; ask before violating

## Development Practices
- Always activate venv before running Python commands
- Check for (.venv) in prompt before executing
- Use Path objects for file operations, not string concatenation
- Preserve existing error handling and logging patterns
